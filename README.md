# Data-Structures
## Assignement 1
For this assignment I wrote four programs which used stacks to perform the same operations as 4 recursive functions. 

## Assignement 2
For this assignement I wrote a program which determined the average height of Binary Search Tree's constructed from random permutation of numbers. This experiment was done to support the hypothesis that the average height of a random binary search tree on n values can be approximated by c*n, c being a constant. 

## Assignement 3
For this assignment I wrote a program which compared two different hash table collision resolution methods: Quadratic Probing and Double Hashing. This experiment demonstrated that double hashing allows for the use of smaller hash tables when trying to achieve a particular level of performance.

## Assignement 4
For this assignement I wrote a program which compared the Breadth First Search and Depth First Search algorithms for a Graph with varying vertices. This experiment demonstrated that as the ammount of vertices increased, the Deapth First Search algorithm became less efficient than the Depth First Search algorithm.
